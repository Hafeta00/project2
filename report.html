    <p> I believe that we  have everything running and working properly. My index.js supports GET, POST, PATCH,
        as well as Delete, which is a soft delete. I used UFW to block the ports except for port 22, 80, 443, and 8443 and blocking the local port 5001. The webservice utilizes nginx and
    my credentials are not in my git repository by using ./gitignore with credentials.json

<p>
Example commands
HTTPS://project2.hafet.me:8443/players/NAME_OF_PLAYER -- This recieves a players stats based on their name
HTTPS://project2.hafet.me:8433/players/id/NEW_ID -- This post updates a players id number
